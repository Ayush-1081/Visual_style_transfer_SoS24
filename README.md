# Visual_style_transfer_SoS24
In this project, we employ neural networks to achieve visual style transfer, transforming the artistic style of one image into another while preserving the original content. By using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we blend elements of famous artworks with everyday photographs, creating unique, visually striking images.
