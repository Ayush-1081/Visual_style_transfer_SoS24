# Python and its Libraries 
#### Libraries we'll be using for our project
- Numpy 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Pytorch (we'll discuss this later)

# Numpy
NumPy is very useful for performing mathematical and logical operations on Arrays. It provides an abundance of useful features for <br>
operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python. <br>
One of the main advantages of Numpy is that vectorisation using numpy arrays makes it super time efiicient. It enables parallel computation <br>
that makes it so fast and hence extremely useful. <br>
I would suggest to give some time and go through this very thoroghly

# Pandas
Pandas is essential for data analysis in Python, allowing easy manipulation, analysis, and cleaning of data. It simplifies <br>
handling large datasets with its powerful tools for filtering, merging, and aggregating information. Again I would suggest <br>
to give some time and go through this very properly.

Before moving forward make sure you're comfortable with performing basic operations on a given data.

# Data Visualisation using Matplotlib
Before constructing analytical models, a data scientist needs to gain insight into the characteristics and connections within a dataset.<br>
The objectives of data exploration and visualization can be summarized into two main goals:
- Grasping the relationships between different data columns
- Finding features that can be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects and identifying any redundant or collinear features.
Therefore, being able to visually explore data is a vital skill in data science. In this context, we'll explore how to analyze data using <br>
various types of plots provided by the matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

# Data Visualisation using Seaborn
Seaborn is important for statistical data visualization in Python, providing beautiful and informative graphics with minimal effort.<br>
It builds on Matplotlib and simplifies complex plotting functions, making it easier to create visually appealing charts. <br>
Unlike Matplotlib,Seaborn comes with built-in themes and color palettes that enhance the aesthetics of plots, and it offers <br>
high-level interfaces for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
